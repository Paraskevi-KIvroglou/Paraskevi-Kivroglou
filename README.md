🤖 AI & ML Specialist by day, Pong-mastering Q-learner by night | Full-stack developer with a mathematical soul

🎯 Currently crafting intelligent systems and making web apps sparkle at inuTech GmbH, while pursuing my MSc in AI because apparently regular programming wasn't complex enough! 

🛠️ Tech Arsenal:
- Fluent in Python, C#, and the art of turning coffee into code
- Building AI assistants that actually assist (looking at you, Llama 2!)
- Making databases dance with SQL
- Cloud-wrangling across AWS, GCP, and Azure

🧮 Former math mentor who helped 200+ students discover that Python is more fun than polynomials

🏋️‍♀️ When not training neural networks, you'll find me training at the gym or capturing the world through my camera lens

🌍 Based in Nuremberg, coding in three languages. Looking to relocate and always ready for the next technical adventure!

📚 Eternal learner, podcast enthusiast, and firm believer that the best code is yet to be written
